I'd love to find an active adopter to take me on walks or play fetch with me. I'm a bit unsure in new situations and would love to find someone who will help build my confidence. I can be a bit protective about my things/food, the staff at GHHS is working on teaching me it's okay to share. I've been around children and I'm crate trained.  I'm currently staying in a foster home.\nPhoto Credit: K8 Photo",

I love to play ball and run around the yard. Unfortunately I do have some separation anxiety and would do best with someone who is home most the time or someone with another friendly dog to keep me company. Small children tend to make me nervous so I would do best with teens and adults. If you think you can give me a great home apply at ghhs.org",
